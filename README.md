Welcome to Maplication!

Deployment URL: maplication-jdc.surge.sh

Developed for best use in phone screen size devices, keep in mind that geolocation only works through secure sites.

Technologies used: HTML5 geolocation, JavaScript geocoding, CSS, Mapbox API.

     The purpose of this app is to quickly and easily record your location with a name and description as well as record a point with an address. The idea is that a user can navigate more easily while traveling. In the future I would like to refactor to make the app offline capable.
